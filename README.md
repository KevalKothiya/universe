JSON Bank. This ensures efficient and reliable access to information without the need for
constant internet connectivity. Users can browse through the planet's details seamlessly, even in
offline mode.

Fetch Planet Details: "Galaxy Planets (Animator)" fetches planet details from the Local JSON
Bank, providing users with comprehensive information about various celestial bodies. Users can
explore each planet's name, description, and associated images, allowing for an educational and
visually rich experience.
